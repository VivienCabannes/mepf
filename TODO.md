#### TODO

Heuristic Search algorithm
- Compute number of queries made
- First start with a naive query counts.
- Then implement the "observation matrix" logic

Bandits algorithm
- Write bandits algorithm.

Evaluation
- Write the algorithms as they appear exactly in the paper.
- Doubling trick for the fixed tree search so to have a function t: num of queries -> estimated mode.
