#### TODO

- get tables from the raw data
- get experiments where set elimination beat everyone

Amelioration
- implement the algorithm where we put back eliminated sets in the game. -> MEPF
I.e. version with put-backs: add a counter for each node on the number of total knowledge. Call it time, and change the variable name on overleaf accordingly
