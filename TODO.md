#### TODO

Evaluation

- launch experiements, check for delta correctness.
- For set elimination, we can restrict the number of queries to be smaller than the one of truncated search before stopping the algorithm.

Amelioration
- implement the algorithm where we put back eliminated sets in the game. -> MEPF
I.e. version with put-backs: add a counter for each node on the number of total knowledge. Call it time, and change the variable name on overleaf accordingly
