#### TODO

Set stopping time according to the limit prescripted by the theorem
N = 108 * p(y_1) / nabla_2^2 log(1 / delta).
if doubling trick:
N = 216 * p(y_1) / nabla_2^2 log(1 / delta).

Calibration to get a good `c`.


- get tables from the raw data
- get experiments where set elimination beat everyone

Amelioration
- implement the algorithm where we put back eliminated sets in the game. -> MEPF
I.e. version with put-backs: add a counter for each node on the number of total knowledge. Call it time, and change the variable name on overleaf accordingly
