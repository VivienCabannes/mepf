#### TODO

Search algorithm
- Write the algorithm of the paper.
- Write the same algorithm that re-use past runs with the "observation matrix" logic.
- Think about how to use past observations to improve sub-tree search.

Bandits algorithm
- Write bandits algorithm.

Evaluation
- Doubling trick for the fixed tree search so to have a function t: num of queries -> estimated mode
