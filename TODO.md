#### TODO

- There is a bug regarding Sanov theorem with ties.

Amelioration:
- implement the algorithm where we put back eliminated sets in the game. -> MEPF
I.e. version with put-backs: add a counter for each node on the number of total knowledge. Call it time, and change the variable name on overleaf accordingly


- Modification:
we stop the stochastic algorithms, but still consider it is a good answer if they are positive at this point in time.
